				<p>A little about myself, my name is Ibrahim Shoukfeh and I am a sophomore here at <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/">UW Madison</a>. Coming into college I wanted to pursue an education in Kinesiology, however, recently I have decided to change my major to Information science with a minor in Data Science. Some interests of mine include soccer, photography, and outdoor activities. I have been playing soccer since I was 6 years old and I loved it then just as much as I love it now. I just recently got into photography and the whole concept of capturing the moment really fascinates me. I am hoping to buy my first camera soon. Some outdoor activities that I enjoy include camping, hiking, and swimming. Over the summer, I made sure to participate in one of those activities everydayI am currently nineteen years old and my birthday is January twentieth. One thing I am hoping to get out of this project is the exposure to simple coding so I could familiarize myself with it and prepare myself for future courses and/or projects.</p>
