                                p>Coming into college I was sure I was going to pursue a degree in Kinesiology, however, I have changed my intended major many times throughout the past year. I went from Kinesiology to Econ, to business. Just recently I finally decided that I will pursue a degree in Information Science with a minor in Data Science and possibly business. With the rapid development of tehcnology, and the increased necessity of data, I found that having a background in logistics, interpreting, and organzing data will be essential when trying to find a job in the future. The job growth of this field is growing at a tremendous rate and I firmly believe choosing this major was the greatest decision in college!</p>
