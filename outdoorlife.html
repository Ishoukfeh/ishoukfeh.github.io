                <p>The great outdoors! They have been a major part of my life ever since I was a kid. The yearly camping trips with my family and friends shaped me to become very fond of the outdoors and surrounded by nature. I found that most people take it for granted and truly don't appreciate the beauty that is out there because of how much tehcnology has taken over our lives. Everytime I am out there, I feel like it's a step back from reality where you can be at peace with no distractions. Over the summer, some of my favorite activities were fishing, swimming, hicking, and camping. <a href="https://www.devilslakewisconsin.com/">Devils Lake</a>, <a href="https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/naturalareas/index.asp?SNA=200">Pewits Nest</a>, and <a href="https://www.danecountyparks.com/park/StewartLake">Stewart Lake</a>, are just some of the many spots where I spent most of my Summer.</p>

                <p>I cannot wait for summer to come around again as I am eager to explore new places again. The thought of swimming and exploring new areas evereyday is what helps me cope with the loads of work and stress that comes with the school year.</p>
