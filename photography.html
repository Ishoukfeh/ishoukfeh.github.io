                <p>Photography is one of the most recent hobbies that I picked up. I really fell in love with it over the Summmer when I would spend majority of my days at the lake or just outside appreicating nature. I began taking pictures with just my phone and edit them on different apps such as VSCO which was time consuming but also really enjoyable. I bought my first disposable camera about halfway through the summer and really liked the aesthetic it brought to the pictures taken. My goal is to purchase my own camera by the start of Winter Break!</p>

                <p>My goal when I hopefully buy this camera is to master rolling shots. That way I will be able to capture artists in the middle of their concerts, or exotic cars while they are driving. A lot of my inspiration comes from instagram, especially my discover page which displays all kinds of unique, fascinating pictures that photgraphers have captured.</p>
