			 	<p>Soccer has been my favorite sport ever since I could walk. My dad would tell me as soon as I could walk I had a ball at my feet that I was kicking around. Growing up, I played on multiple teams such as Middleton United and Rush. Devloping a passion for it at such a young age and having the privelage of playing on these teams allowed me to hone my skills and better myself as a player.</p>

				<p>Over the summer, my friends and I formed a team and played in the Keva outdoor league. The games were weekly and majority of the other teams were older than us. It was tough competition but we had loads of fun!</p>
